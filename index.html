<h3>The power of word use is shown in most of Eminem’s work, but this song especially.  “Why be a king when you can be a god?” - Eminem </h3>


<h2> Daft Punk “Technologic”</h2>


<h3>This song reminds me of my programing nights, when everyone else has gone to sleep, and I am still chugging along for perfection. </h3>  


<h2> Coldplay “Life in Technicolor II”</h2>


<h3>Over the years, Coldplay, has seemed to narrate my journey.  Not always the lyrics, but the way the songs feel after experiencing them.  </h3>

<h3>There are many unexplainable events in the world, one is how I like this song.  I don’t understand it, but it just works.   </h3> 



<h2>Chris Brown  “Don’t Judge Me”</h2>


<h3> Being judged is something I am use to and honestly, switching from engineering to communications hasn’t helped. But, I am happy now.   </h3> 

 
<h2>My Chemical Romance “The Black Parade”</h2>


<h3>This is for my fight to become some sort of leader for my family.  I strive to be seen as a role model because my kids and wife deserve it.  </h3>

<h3>Something many people don’t see in me is my silliness and this Flobots always seems to remind me of what I will always have inside. </h3>
